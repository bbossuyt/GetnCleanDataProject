Code book describing the variables including data/units for the tidy data set:
* Activity: the type of physcial activity performed during the experiment
  * -- WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
* Subject: number (from 1-30) assigned to volunteer who performed the activity
* Features: Under each of the following columns, the average was calculated for each subject
and activity and normalized between -1 and 1.
